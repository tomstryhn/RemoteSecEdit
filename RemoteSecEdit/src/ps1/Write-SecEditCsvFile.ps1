    .SYNOPSIS
        Writes rows to a csv file with a UTF-8 byte order mark on both engines.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Used for every csv file the module writes (results.csv, accounts.csv), so both are built
        the same way: ConvertTo-Csv -NoTypeInformation turns the rows into lines, and
        [System.IO.File]::WriteAllLines writes them with a UTF8Encoding whose byte order mark is
        on, which is what Export-Csv -Encoding UTF8 does not give consistently across Windows
        PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7. Every string value is trimmed and its whitespace collapsed to single spaces
        first, so each cell is one line. An empty Row collection writes no lines at all unless
        Column is supplied, in which case a header-only file is built from Column instead, since
        ConvertTo-Csv produces nothing at all, not even a header, for zero input objects.

    .PARAMETER Row
        The rows to write. May be empty.

    .PARAMETER Path
        The file to write, as a literal path.

    .PARAMETER Column
        The column names, in order, used to build a header-only file when Row is empty. Ignored
        when Row is not empty, since ConvertTo-Csv derives the header from the rows themselves.

        # One line per csv cell: a string value is trimmed and its whitespace, line breaks included, collapsed to one space, so a line break inside a value can never split a csv row. Each row's strings are scanned once; a row with no string that needs a change goes in as the caller's own object, because copying every row cost most of the time on a 20,000-row file. Only a row that needs a change is rebuilt as a new ordered object with the same property names, so the caller's objects, and the json files written from them, keep the source form. The test is any whitespace other than single inner spaces, which is exactly the set the collapse would alter. Null, an empty string, numbers and booleans pass through untouched, which keeps a null a bare cell and an empty string a quoted empty cell.
